# percentage

Changed font to Roboto (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) to make it better looking on my 720p screen.
Forked from Furfx, who made the original (by kas) transparent.
Compiled with Visual Studio 2017.

File exe available here: https://github.com/EdoGimo/percentage/releases/tag/v1.3.0
